In order to  execute the files correctly the following toolboxes are needed:
1) FAIR-toolbox with TBIR and LagLDDMM add-on 
which can be downloaded via
GitHub: https://github.com/lukaslang/FAIR.m/tree/v1.1

If your're using a windows distrubution, the mentioned version might be missing some mex files. Those can found here:
https://github.com/C4IR/FAIR.m/pull/9

2) toolbox_optim from www.numerical-tours.com.
GitHub: https://github.com/gpeyre/matlab-toolboxes

Follow the instructions from the TBIR-READ ME file and move this folder to FAIR\add-ons.

You can find the scripts, which produced the results in the paper in scripts/Third order. 
We also added additional scripts, which use a curvature regulariser instead in scripts/curvature.
